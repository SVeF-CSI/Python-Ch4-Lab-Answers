# Python TUPLES Lab - Arguments
print('''
Python Tuples - Tuples are used to pass argument 
values back and forth from functions.

Challenge #1
- Run this code. See how you pass 3 arguments as a 
  tuple, get 2 arguments returned as a tuple, but 
  assigned to variables Sum and Avg which are 
  type<int> and <float>

- See that the type(sum_and_avg(3, 8, 5)) of the 
  function is <tuple>
      
- Update the function to pass a tuple of random 
  length set of numbers, and then return the 
  same 2 values in a tuple      
   ''')

def sum_and_avg(local_tup_set):
  x=len(local_tup_set)
  s=0
  for i in local_tup_set:
    print(i)
    s = s + i
  a = s/x
  return(s, a)
# see that the type( of the function is <tuple>)
#tup_set = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,)
tup_set = (2,2,2,2,)  
print(type(sum_and_avg(tup_set)))
(Sum, Avg) = sum_and_avg(tup_set)
print('Sum =', Sum)
print(type(Sum))
print('Avg =', Avg)
print(type(Avg))
